# Start New SaaS Project

You've invoked the `/start-project` command to begin a new SaaS project.

## What Happens Next

I'll invoke the **saas-project-orchestrator** skill, which will guide you through the complete SDLC:

### Phase 0: Deep Discovery (90 minutes) ← We start here
- Comprehensive structured interview
- Extract complete requirements
- Document workflows, data model, edge cases
- Define success criteria
- **Deliverable:** 15-25 page discovery document

### Phase 1: Test Scenarios (Week 1)
- Generate Gherkin scenarios from workflows
- Create acceptance criteria
- **Deliverable:** 40-60 test scenarios

### Phase 2: Schema Design (Week 1)
- Extract data model from discovery
- Design multi-tenant architecture
- **Deliverable:** .apsorc schema file

### Phase 3: Product Brief (Week 1)
- Synthesize into comprehensive PRD
- **Deliverable:** Product requirements document

### Phase 4: Roadmap & Tasks (Week 1)
- Phase scenarios into delivery waves
- Create implementation tasks
- **Deliverable:** Phased roadmap + task list

### Phase 5+: Implementation (Weeks 2-12)
- Backend bootstrap (Apso)
- Frontend bootstrap (Next.js)
- Authentication (Better Auth)
- Feature implementation
- Testing & QA
- Deployment

## Why Discovery First?

**The Philosophy:**
> "Incomplete or bad information at discovery leads to incomplete or bad implementation later."

**The Data:**
- Discovery phase: 2% of project time
- Prevents: 80% of implementation issues
- Cost to fix requirements post-launch: **100x more expensive**

## Ready?

I'm invoking the saas-project-orchestrator now. You'll start with the 90-minute discovery interview.

**What SaaS product do you want to build?**
